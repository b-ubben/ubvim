# Truly minimal vim

This is my configuration for a workable vim setup with __NO__ extra
plugins or strange/personal abstractions.

A little bit more sensible than sensible VIM, imo.

Meant to be available for me to pull down onto whatever server I'd like
and provide a working VIM config in the case of me having to write
scripts, etc.
