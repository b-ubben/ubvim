# Truly minimal vim

This is my configuration for a workable vim setup with __NO__ extra
plugins or strange/personal abstractions.

A little bit more sensible than sensible VIM, imo.

Meant to be available for me to pull down onto whatever server I'd like
and provide a working VIM config in the case of me having to write
scripts, etc.

## UPDATED 4/28/20
added configurations for neovim w/plugins to suit front end development in JS/TS, etc.

also added install scripts (that are mostly untested -- if you care to use them, they're pretty simple).
